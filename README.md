#E_Commerce_App

E-Commerce_App using dart (Flutter)

    the logo is designed by me using a templete from FreePik website.

    the data in the market cached from the endpoint: https://dummyjson.com/products

    Images of products is previewed using carousel slider (hint : https://pub.dev/packages/carousel_slider)

    the Authentication is done by Firebase Auth and Users.

    cart screen is coded using Provider Package.

    when the app closed the cart will be cleared.

    when close the app and reopen it the user not need to log in again.

    validation was done in Sign up and log In Screens where, when the user enter a password not equal the confrimed passsword then the app will give the user a message "Password not Matched" and other validations in all Text fields.

    thank you ...
